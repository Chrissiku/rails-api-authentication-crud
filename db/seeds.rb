# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# require 'faker'

# User.all.each do |user|
#   3.times do
#     user.companies.create(name: Faker::Company.name, address: Faker::Address.full_address, established_year: Faker::Date.between(from: 10.years.ago, to: Date.today))
#   end

# User.first.update(role: "super_admin")
